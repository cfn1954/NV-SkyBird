# NV-SkyBird

This is a program to read specific uncompressed wave files and play them using openAL.   The only dependency is to have installed the openAL libraries and header files.  I can't take credit for the program as it was originally coded in C++, then converted to C rather poorly by others on the web.  What I did was fix the errors that were causing it not to work, put back some of the original error checking, fix the feedback prompts, and add command line input.  My C coding skills are limited and quite rusty so this program is offered without warrantee of any kind.  It works for me, but it may miss-behave  and melt your cpu.  It should be a good reference for someone that wants to play sounds using openAL.  It took several hours of searching to find anything useful with google so if you are here you have saved some time.

I have compiled this code against the openAL-soft libraries, but it will likely work with the OS X included libraies as well.


You can consider this code to be public domain, since I have no way to track its original source.  Included is the original C++ code I pulled off  a blog
somewhere.
